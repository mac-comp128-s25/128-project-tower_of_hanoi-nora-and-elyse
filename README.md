# Tower of Hanoi

Elyse Quigley and Nora Betry

Steps for running game:
Click the button above the tower which you are removing the disk from.
Click the button above the tower which you are moving the disk to. 
Watch the disk move from tower to tower
    Note: when making multiple moves, you are able to make a move before the previous move's animation has been completed, with 
    no issues EXCEPT when it is the final move of the game. It causes the round to end early, but this is a minimal bug. 
    
To see the automated best solution:
Click "help" in the top left corner.
Click next step to see each move one by one. 
    Note: You are able to "take over" from the auto solution by making your own move at any time! You can also click help at any point in solving, but it will reset the towers to their original position.
